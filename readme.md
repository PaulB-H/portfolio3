This is my third portfolio assignment.

I wanted to rebuild it using materialize since we used it for our first project.

I had some more issues with how custom styling works with the prebuild materialize elements, and had to change the navbar style I was going to go for, overall I am happy with the minimal design and neat parallax effect.

Current minor - issue

Had to add an empty div above my actual headers for the sections, because when refrencing them on the navbar the navbar would overlay the header. When I set ID for the navbar to be the div with two BR's in it above the section headers didnt get cut off.

I wanted to do something in javascript so upon clicking the link, it creates a div to target/expands it, moved you to that section of the page, but then hides the spacer div again (I hate too much blank space...)
