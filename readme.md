This is my third portfolio assignment.

I wanted to rebuild it using materialize since we used it for our first project.

I had some more issues with how custom styling works with the prebuild materialize elements, and had to change the navbar style I was going to go for, overall I am happy with the minimal design and neat parallax effect.
